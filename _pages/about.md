I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at Oxford University in the Departmenet of Politics and International Relations. I am also a Skoll ECR Fellow at the Said Business School. I work on the Climate Vulnerability Project with Professor Federica Genovese. I recieved my PhD and MPhil in International Realtions from Nuffiled College, Oxford University, and my B (Hons) from the Australian National University. My PhD used a theory of corporate reputation to explain firm behaviour in climate change, geopolitics and economic statecraft. I'm trained in R, Python, statistics, causal inference techniques, data analytics, computational methods and machine learning techniques. I work across the intersection of business-politics and public policy.

I occasionally engage in consultation work for government or NGOs focused on geopolitics, climate change, and trade.
